## **Hello!** :wave:
Nice to see you! I'm Bence, from Hungary 🇭🇺, and currently helping in the [GGR-Devs](https://github.com/GGR-Devs) team to revive discounted games.
In my free time, I often work on projects that aim to help my daily tasks. However, until they’re complete, it sometimes feels like I’m only adding to the complexity.

### My current projects:
| Name | Desc | 
|  --------  |  -------  |
| [GGRebornApp](https://github.com/ggr-devs/ggreborn-app)| Simple, highly customizable client with built in flash player |
| GGRServer | A Go game server engine for hosting GGR games (discounted GGS games), built with Hurka. Its a port intended to replace the SmartFoxServer. The server features command register, error handler, command validators (anti cheat), room management, client handling, game manager.  |
| [Kofitab](https://github.com/bxn4/kofitab)| Highly customizable and easy to use homepage |
| [QuickQuiz](https://github.com/bxn4/quickquiz) | Simple, modern Discord Quiz bot made in Go |
